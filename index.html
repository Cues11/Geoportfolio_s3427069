        I am highly motivated geospatial science professional currently pursuing
        my Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) with Honours at RMIT
        University. Currently in my final year doing my honours on a Time -
        Series Characterizing Spectral Trajectory of Riparian Vegetation Using
        Landsat 8 Imagery. My expertise includes cartographic design, spatial
        database management, and remote sensing, with proficiency in tools such
        as ArcGIS Pro, Adobe Illustrator, and QGIS. My hands-on experience as a
        GIS Intern at DEECA and a Student GIS/Surveyor at Aurecon Group, where I
        have developed a strong foundation in spatial analysis and data
        management.
        <p>
          I have been recognized for my academic excellence with awards like the
          Jacob Prize and the Tetra Tech Prize, reflecting my dedication to the
          field. In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong background
          in project management, critical thinking, and problem-solving, which I
          apply to both my professional and extracurricular activities.
        </p>
        Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing the cello and recently
        joined a beginner orchestra at SQUAWKESTRA to develop my collaboration
        skills. I am also passionate about ice hockey, playing at a national
        level for the Melbourne Ducks during the 2024/2025 season and part of
        the Demons Ice Hockey club as the teasurer. Additionally, I have a love
        for outdoor adventures, from hiking to climbing, which allows me to
        connect with the natural world.

        Studying Cartography at RMIT University, I was able to delved into the
        complex and evolving field of map-making. I began by learning the basic
        principles of cartography, which included understanding map resources
        and exploring contemporary mapping products. This foundation of
        knowledge allowed me to understand various methods of transforming the
        physical environment into detailed map products grasping the key
        elements of effective map design. As I advanced in my studies, I
        developed professional map-making skills, enabling me to design
        imformative and accurate maps using a range of spatial data. Working
        with ABS datasets to Vicmap datasets, my experience at RMIT equipped me
        with the expertise to create maps that are not only technically sound
        but also visually compelling. Below are some topics that I have covered
        in the Cartography classes:

        My major spatial analysis project is on spatial Interpolation of Solar
        Radiation for Solar Farming in Tasmania. Doing these projects has helped
        me developed me skills in inetegration of different datasets,
        indentifying spatial patterns, provide insight and support for policies
        and decision making. This study evaluates the suitability of solar
        farming in Tasmania through the application of spatial interpolation
        techniques, specifically Kriging, to analyze solar radiation and
        rainfall data over a 12-month period. Utilizing data from the Bureau of
        Meteorology, the research identifies the most appropriate regions for
        solar farming based on a comprehensive spatial analysis. Results
        indicate that 57% of Tasmania is suitable for solar farming, 27% is
        unsuitable, and 16% is moderately suitable. The findings provide
        valuable insights for local governments, businesses, and farmers,
        offering recommendations for optimizing solar energy investments and
        guiding policy development in renewable energy infrastructure.

        I developed a strong foundation in cloud-based open-source GIS by
        building my own spatial database through PostGIS and PostgresSQL and
        exploreing the topic of urban heat islands (UHI) and vegetation in
        Melbourne. This involved utilizing various systems and tools, including
        GitHub, Azure, QGIS, GeoServer, and Leaflet, to create an interactive
        web map, demonstrating the integration of cloud services and open data
        for geospatial analysis. The project architecture followed a three-tier
        structure, ensuring efficient data management with PostGIS, seamless
        deployment through GeoServer and Azure, and user-friendly visualization
        using Leaflet.

        During my time with Aurecon, which began in February 2022, I aimed to
        immerse myself in the GIS and surveying industry, as it was my first
        experience in this field. I worked on a range of tasks that helped me
        develop a basic understanding of both technical skills and industry
        practices.
        <p>
          In the Surveying department, I focused on rail extraction using
          MicroStation, a CAD software platform. My work involved processing
          point clouds and using Topdot to draw lines and identify features such
          as platforms, buildings, rail tracks and embankments. This process was
          crucial for creating Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) to analyze
          elevation levels in the withn the rail corridor. I;ve also been out in
          the field Conducting fieldwork to perform comprehensive Feature
          Surveys in and performing Levelling Surveys in the field to ensure
          accurate elevation data
        </p>
        In the GIS department, I worked extensively with DBYD (Dial Before You
        Dig) documents, organizing and georeferencing various sites using ArcGIS
        Pro. This task required digitizing underground assets such as
        telecommunications networks, pipelines, NBN cables and more.

          During my internship, which began in August 2024, I worked on creating
          detailed datasets for infrastructure on public lands using ArcGIS Pro.
          I carefully attributed the data, ensuring all fields were accurately
          completed, utilizing Google Maps to provide further reliable
          information. This effort was aimed at making structures easily
          identifiable in case of emergencies. Additionally, I digitized and
          attributed infrastructure points in the Mt. Baw Baw area, focusing on
          mapping and accurately maintaining records of various infrastructure
          features, ensuring up-to-date data for efficient management.
